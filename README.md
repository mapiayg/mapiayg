# About me

Hi, my name is Miguel Ángel Piay García.

### I'm currently pursuing a degree in
[Computer Engineering](https://estudios.uoc.edu/es/grados/ingenieria-informatica/presentacion)
at UOC university.

### While at High School
- I learned and became interested in `programming` and `physical computing`.
- I created quite a few projects using both text and block-based programming languages.

### My professional goal is
to become a `backend software developer`.

### I’m especially interested in
learning about `distributed computing`.

### My aspiration is
to contribute to the creation of new software paradigms and the implementation of digital emerging technologies, solutions and applications ranging from Massively Multiplayer Online `MMO` video games to the `blockchain` and the `metaverse`.

### On the personal side
I enjoy hanging out with friends, playing video games and practising fighting sports.
