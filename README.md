Hi, my name is **Miguel Ángel Piay García.**

I'm currently pursuing a degree in **Computer Engineering at UOC University**.

My passion for technology began in high school, where I explored programming and physical computing through both text-based and block-based languages, developing several hands-on projects that fueled my curiosity for software and systems.

My goal is to grow as a **software engineer** with a focus on **Artificial Intelligence, distributed computing and scalable architectures**, and ultimately evolve into a **technology architect** designing innovative solutions at the intersection of intelligent systems and emerging digital ecosystems, from AI-driven applications to immersive online platforms.

Outside of technology, I enjoy spending time with friends, playing video games and practising fighting sports.
